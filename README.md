# AKGEC Connect

AKGEC Connect is the official AKGEC app that aims to act as a companion app for the students of AKGEC. The app contains several useful modules that enable students to stay up-to-date with all the college news, maintain a schedule according to their timetable, find out all about interesting places in and around college, and more.

But this project is a lot more than an app. This is an initiative that is targetted at all the emerging developers of AKGEC and encourages them to take part in this as a collaborative open-source team effort. So if you are an AKGECian and you love developing things and wish to see them used by a large number of people, you have come to the right place.

### 3.Locations
Locations help you to get around the whole college by providing you with all hotspots that AKGECians frequent. You can think of it as a Bible of all the places in AKGEC and not only that, you can visit that location in a map and also check how far you are and how much time it will take you to reach there.
